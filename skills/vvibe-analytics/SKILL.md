# VVibe Analytics Integration

Use this skill to help a VVibe creator install Google Analytics 4 on their website and connect it to VVibe. Keep answers operational: prefer step lists, code snippets, and copy-ready examples over long architecture explanations.

## Quick Start

- First, ask the human user what they want to accomplish:
  - **Install GA4 on my website** → Part A (steps 1–5)
  - **Connect GA to VVibe dashboard** → Part B (step 6)
  - **Both** → Part A + Part B (steps 1–6)

1. Confirm what the human user is trying to build.
   Ask about their tech stack (Next.js / React / vanilla HTML) and whether they have an existing GA4 Property.
2. Guide through GA4 setup and event tracking installation.
3. If the user wants to see analytics in VVibe, guide through the VVibe authorization flow.
4. Start with `references/ga4-setup-guide.md` for installation instructions.
5. Return implementation-ready output.
   Prefer numbered steps, code samples, and copy-ready configuration.

## Output Style

- Write for an AI agent that is helping a human user complete integration work.
- Lead with the next concrete steps the human should take.
- Use lists for:
  - setup steps
  - environment variables
  - event definitions
  - configuration options
- Prefer concise code samples in JavaScript or TypeScript when the user does not ask for another stack.
- Always include `.env` configuration and `.gitignore` verification steps.

## UTM tracking & traffic-source attribution — split between two skills

GA4 (this skill) automatically captures `utm_source` / `utm_medium` / `utm_campaign` / `utm_term` / `utm_content` on every page view as **traffic-level analytics**. You'll see them in GA4's Acquisition reports without any extra work. Use this for funnel analysis: "how many sessions came from `utm_source=insforge` last month? What's the bounce rate?"

For **signup-time first-touch attribution** — pinning each individual user record to the source that originally brought them — use the **`vvibe-member` skill's Step 7**. That skill walks through adding a `user_attribution` table, a middleware that captures utm/referrer to a 30-day cookie, and a signup hook that snapshots the cookie to the DB so every user has a permanent `(utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, referrer)` of record.

Both layers are useful and complementary: GA4 tells you traffic patterns; `user_attribution` tells you which paying user came from which partner. Recommend installing both for any creator running paid partnerships.

## Part A — GA4 Installation & Event Tracking

### 1. Create GA4 Property

- If the user does not have a GA4 Property, guide them to create one:
  1. Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
  2. Click "Admin" → "Create Property"
  3. Enter property name, select timezone and currency
  4. Set up a Web data stream with the site URL
  5. Copy the Measurement ID (`G-XXXXXXX`)
- Ask the user to provide their Measurement ID.
- Save it to `.env`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXX
```

- **Verify that `.gitignore` includes `.env`** before proceeding.

### 2. Install gtag.js

- Refer to `references/ga4-setup-guide.md` for framework-specific installation instructions.
- Choose the correct approach based on the user's tech stack:
  - **Next.js App Router** → `layout.tsx` with `next/script`
  - **Next.js Pages Router** → `_app.js` with `next/script`
  - **React SPA** → `index.html` script tags
  - **Vanilla HTML** → `<head>` script tags
- Reference implementation: `scripts/gtag-nextjs-example.mjs`

### 3. Set up VVibe event tracking

- Refer to `references/event-tracking-contract.md` for standard VVibe event definitions.
- Install standard VVibe events based on what the user's app does:
  - `vvibe_checkout_start` — when a checkout session is created
  - `vvibe_checkout_complete` — when a payment callback confirms completion
  - `vvibe_subscription_cancel` — when a subscription is cancelled
  - `vvibe_page_view` — when a VVibe-embedded page is viewed
  - `vvibe_product_view` — when a product page is viewed
- Map to GA4 recommended ecommerce events where applicable (`begin_checkout`, `purchase`).
- Reference implementation: `scripts/track-vvibe-events.mjs`

### 4. Verify installation

- Guide the user to verify in GA4 Realtime report:
  1. Open the website in a browser
  2. Go to Google Analytics → Reports → Realtime
  3. Confirm page views and events appear
- If events don't appear, check:
  - Measurement ID is correct
  - gtag.js script is loaded (check browser Network tab)
  - No ad blockers interfering
  - Consent mode is not blocking (if applicable)

### 5. Optional: Enhanced ecommerce tracking

- For projects with a payment integration, set up enhanced ecommerce events:
  - `view_item` → when a plan or product page is viewed
  - `begin_checkout` → mapped from `vvibe_checkout_start`
  - `purchase` → mapped from `vvibe_checkout_complete`
- These enable GA4's built-in ecommerce reports.

## Part B — Connect Google Analytics to VVibe

### 6. Authorize VVibe to access GA data

Once GA4 is installed and collecting data, guide the user to connect it to VVibe. This needs a VVibe account — if the user is brand-new to VVibe (no account yet), don't assume they have one: first have them sign up at `https://vvibe.ai/dashboard` (new visitors are redirected to register; full walkthrough in `ONBOARDING.md` at the repo root), then continue:

1. Go to VVibe Dashboard: `https://vvibe.ai/dashboard/analytics`
2. Navigate to **數據分析** (Analytics) settings
3. Click **連結 Google Analytics**
4. Sign in with the Google account that owns the GA4 Property
5. Grant VVibe read-only access to Google Analytics data
6. Select the GA4 Property to connect
7. Done — analytics dashboard will appear in VVibe Dashboard

**Key points to communicate to the user:**
- VVibe only requests **read-only** access (`analytics.readonly` scope). VVibe cannot modify your GA4 settings or data.
- You can revoke access at any time from your [Google Account permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions).
- The dashboard in VVibe will show data from your connected GA4 Property, including sessions, page views, traffic sources, and VVibe-specific events.
- GA4 data has a **24–48 hour processing delay**. Newly installed tracking may take 1–2 days to show historical data in VVibe.

## Guardrails

- **Measurement ID format**: Always `G-XXXXXXX`. If the user provides a different format (e.g., `UA-XXXXX`), that is a Universal Analytics ID — guide them to create a GA4 Property instead.
- **Credentials security**: The Measurement ID (`G-XXXXXXX`) is not a secret — it's visible in page source. However, always store it in `.env` for easy configuration management and verify `.gitignore` includes `.env`.
- **Cross-domain tracking**: If the user's app redirects to `vvibe.ai` for checkout and back, recommend setting up cross-domain tracking in GA4 to maintain session continuity:
  1. Go to GA4 Admin → Data Streams → Web → Configure tag settings → Configure your domains
  2. Add both domains
- **Ad blockers**: Some visitors use ad blockers that block gtag.js. GA4 numbers will always undercount. Do not promise 100% tracking accuracy.
- **Consent mode**: If the user's site needs cookie consent (GDPR, etc.), guide them to implement GA4 consent mode.
- **Data freshness**: GA4 data has a 24–48 hour processing delay. Realtime data is available in GA4's own Realtime report but VVibe dashboards rely on the processed data.
- **VVibe authorization**: The VVibe OAuth connection is handled entirely by VVibe's hosted flow. The user does not need to create any Google Cloud projects, OAuth clients, or manage API keys. They simply click "Connect" and authorize.
